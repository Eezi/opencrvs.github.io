OpenCRVS is a [digital public good](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/) designed for those it serves - to make civil registration easy. This functional documentation aims to tell you how OpenCRVS works for its users and how it can work for you. It includes an overview of the functional architecture and then explores each functional area along with videos to demonstrate this functionality in action.

The examples you will see are OpenCRVS as configured in Zambia and Bangladesh. To use OpenCRVS in your country, see [Configuration](configuration).

We hope that you can see some features and functionality that will help you make civil registration easy where you work. The product reflects common needs that we have seen across the world, but we do recognise unique scenarios in each country. Remember, OpenCRVS can be configured for your context and we highlight just how this works throughout the documentation.
